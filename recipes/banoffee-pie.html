    <p>Banoffee pie is a British dessert made with banana slices, whipped cream, and a caramel sauce. The original
        recipe, created in 1971, is attributed to the owner and chef of Hungry Monk Restaurant in Sussex. Its name is a
        combination of the words “banana” and “toffee.”</p>

    <p>Banoffee pie has gooey toffee, banana, and crunchy graham crackers in every bite. It's an incredibly rich and
        delicious dessert, so a little goes a long way, but anyone who tries it loves it!</p>
